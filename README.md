OpenCode Goal Plugin adds Codex-style long-running goal mode to OpenCode. It gives AI coding agents a `/goal` slash command, persistent goal state, completion evidence, idle continuation, and a terminal UI goal indicator so an OpenCode session can keep working toward one explicit objective until it is complete, blocked, or cleared.

If you are searching for an OpenCode goal plugin, goal mode for OpenCode, or a way to keep an OpenCode AI coding agent focused on a long-running task, this package is the npm plugin for that workflow.

Links:

- npm package: [`@yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin)
- GitHub repository: [`yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin`](https://github.com/yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin)
- OpenCode plugin command: `opencode plugin @yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin`

The OpenCode Goal Plugin adds:

- `/goal <objective>`, `/pause_goal`, and `/resume_goal` as OpenCode commands for TUI, desktop, web, and remote integrations that expose the server command catalog.
- A sidebar goal indicator with status, elapsed time, and objective.
- Agent tools: `get_goal`, `get_goal_history`, `list_all_goals`, `create_goal`, `set_goal`, `update_goal_objective`, `update_goal_status`, `update_goal`, `stop_goal`, `replace_goal`, `update_goal_plan`, and `clear_goal`.
- Goal close evidence: `complete` requires verified evidence, and `unmet` requires a concrete blocker.
- Persistent per-session goal state with history, checkpoints, budgets, and owner-only file permissions.
- Optional automatic continuation on `session.idle` / `session.status`, with no-progress pause and budget wrap-up safeguards.
- Plan-mode safety: goals created from the `plan` agent stay paused, and auto-continue never escapes a Plan-mode session or switches agents on its own.
- Compaction context so active goals are preserved when OpenCode summarizes a long session.

## Why Use This OpenCode Goal Plugin?

Use this plugin when you want OpenCode to behave more like a goal-driven coding agent instead of a one-prompt assistant. A goal stays visible, survives session compaction, can continue automatically when the session becomes idle, and can only be closed with explicit evidence or a concrete blocker.

Common use cases:

- Keep an OpenCode agent focused during long refactors, migrations, reviews, or test-fixing sessions.
- Track one explicit objective across TUI, desktop, and web OpenCode surfaces.
- Require completion evidence before a goal is marked done.
- Preserve the current goal when OpenCode summarizes or compacts a long conversation.

## Install

Choose the instructions that match the CLI you run:

| OpenCode version  | How to identify it                                       | Instructions                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| OpenCode 1 stable | You run `opencode` and `opencode --version` prints `1.x` | [OpenCode 1](#opencode-1-stable) |
| OpenCode 2 beta   | You run `opencode2`                                      | [OpenCode 2](#opencode-2-beta)   |

Do not mix the configuration formats. OpenCode 1 uses `plugin` and `tui.json`; OpenCode 2 uses `plugins` and the global `cli.json`.

### OpenCode 1 Stable

Install for the current project:

```bash
opencode plugin @yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin
```

Install globally:

```bash
opencode plugin -g @yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin
```

OpenCode detects both package entrypoints and writes the plugin into the server and TUI config targets.

For manual installation, add the package to both V1 config files.

`opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["@yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin"]
}
```

`tui.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["@yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin"]
}
```

### OpenCode 2 Beta

Use this section only when running `opencode2`. Plugin releases from the `feat/v2-adaptation` line support OpenCode 2 beta `0.0.0-beta-19425` (the current `@opencode/cli@beta` / `@opencode/plugin@beta` contract) while remaining compatible with OpenCode 1.

Add the package to both V2 plugin lists:

`opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin"]
}
```

`~/.config/opencode/cli.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin"]
}
```

OpenCode 2 does not read the V1 `tui.json` file. The server entrypoint comes from `opencode.json`, while the sidebar and palette integration come from `~/.config/opencode/cli.json`.

OpenCode 2 plugin APIs are still beta. This package pins its V2 development contract to the beta version above; later previews may require a compatible plugin update. V2 currently supports the goal command, tools, persistent state, usage accounting, idle continuation, Plan-mode safety, TUI sidebar/palette integration, goal compaction context, and transcript-based task recovery. Goal compaction context is injected through the stable V2 `session.compaction` hook, deduplicated so the goal snapshot appears once. After a plugin or server restart, V2 rebuilds Task-subagent deferral state by replaying each non-closed goal session's persisted transcript, because the V2 plugin context exposes no live child-session query; children that leave no finalized tool entry in the transcript are only observed through live events.

## Options

In OpenCode 1, server options use the package-and-options tuple in `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": [
    [
      "@yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin",
      {
        "auto_continue": true,
        "defer_while_tasks_active": true,
        "max_auto_turns": 25,
        "min_continue_interval_seconds": 3,
        "max_turn_time": 300,
        "max_task_block_seconds": 900,
        "max_prompt_failures": 3,
        "locale": "zh-CN",
        "default_token_budget": 200000,
        "max_goal_duration_seconds": 1800,
        "no_progress_token_threshold": 50,
        "max_no_progress_turns": 2,
        "restricted_agents": ["plan"],
        "allow_goal_execution_from_plan": false,
        "max_objective_chars": 100000
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

In OpenCode 2, use the plugin object form instead:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "package": "@yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin",
      "options": {
        "auto_continue": true,
        "max_auto_turns": 25,
        "locale": "zh-CN",
        "default_token_budget": 200000,
        "restricted_agents": ["plan"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

For OpenCode 1, server and TUI plugins are configured separately. To force the TUI to the same locale, use the same
option in `tui.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": [
    [
      "@yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin",
      {
        "locale": "zh-CN"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

Defaults:

- `auto_continue`: `true`
- `defer_while_tasks_active`: `true`; when enabled, goal auto-continuation waits for active OpenCode Task child sessions and their orchestrator reconciliation before sending the next goal prompt. A deferral re-checks child sessions on a short timer, so a goal deferred by a task never depends on a further idle event to resume.
- `max_task_block_seconds`: `900`; wall-clock ceiling on how long a single Task child session may defer goal continuation. A child that stays listed but never reports a terminal state, or a terminal child whose result is never reconciled, stops blocking once the ceiling passes. Set a smaller value for shorter subagents, `0` to remove the ceiling, or disable deferral entirely with `defer_while_tasks_active: false`.
- `max_auto_turns`: `25`; explicitly resuming a goal with `/goal resume` or `/resume_goal` after it reaches this limit starts a fresh auto-turn window. Token usage and elapsed-time usage are preserved.
- `min_continue_interval_seconds`: `3`
- Fast V2 executions that finish inside this interval schedule a delayed continuation; they do not require another user message to wake up.
- `max_turn_time`: unset by default; set a positive number of seconds to retry one active-goal continuation prompt when a model turn remains busy for that long. Each new busy event resets the watchdog. Idle, built-in retry, session deletion, active Task children, and restricted agents suppress the retry. Watchdog retries are independent of `min_continue_interval_seconds` and never consume auto-turn or no-progress budgets, but recognized transport failures still count toward the `max_prompt_failures` ceiling.
- `pause_elapsed_while_waiting`: `true`; pending permission approvals and user-input forms block automatic continuation and turn-watchdog rescue. By default the goal's elapsed clock freezes until the final request is answered or cancelled. Set `false` to keep elapsed accounting running; automation remains blocked either way. Token usage and token budgets remain enforced while waiting. Explicit resume or objective edits preserve unresolved human waits.
- `max_prompt_failures`: `3`; consecutive transport or no-response continuation failures pause the goal at this ceiling. Prompt delivery alone does not reset the count; substantive assistant or tool progress, a new goal, or an explicit resume does.
- `default_token_budget`: unset by default; when set, new goals inherit this token budget.
- `max_goal_duration_seconds`: unset by default; when set, new goals inherit this elapsed-time safety limit.
- `no_progress_token_threshold`: `50`; output-token floor used to judge whether a goal continuation turn made progress.
- `max_no_progress_turns`: `2`; consecutive low-progress goal continuation turns before pausing. Only turns produced by a reserved goal continuation count — ordinary low-output assistant messages (for example short tool-call-only turns from PTY or status checks) never increment this counter.
- `locale`: `"en-US"` by default. Set `"zh-CN"` for Simplified Chinese, or `"auto"` to detect `LC_ALL`, then `LANG`, then
  the OS/JavaScript runtime locale. Unsupported explicit locales fall back to US English (`en-US`).
- `register_command`: `true`; registers `/goal`, `/pause_goal`, and `/resume_goal`.
- `command_name`: `"goal"`; renames the main goal command only. The reserved names `pause_goal` and `resume_goal` fall back to `goal` so the standalone controls remain available.
- `restricted_agents`: `["plan"]`; agents (matched case-insensitively) treated as planning-only for goal execution.
- `allow_goal_execution_from_plan`: `false`; when `true`, disables Plan-mode goal restrictions entirely.
- `max_objective_chars`: `100000`; maximum Unicode code-point length of the submitted goal objective, completion evidence,
  and blocker text. The previous 4000-character cap was a defect, not a compatibility constraint. The same limit is
  advertised on V1 and V2 tool schemas and enforced at runtime, independently per plugin instance. Accepted values are
  trimmed before persistence. Large objectives are echoed into continuation and compaction prompts.

## Goal Workflow

Use `/goal <objective>` in a fresh OpenCode chat to create a long-running goal:

```text
/goal review the frontend and translate visible English UI text to Spanish
```

Bare `/goal` reports the current goal state. `/goal history` reports the current and archived goal lifecycle history. `/goal edit <objective>` updates the current objective. `/goal pause` pauses the goal without closing it, and `/goal resume` resumes it. The standalone `/pause_goal` and `/resume_goal` controls are discoverable by remote integrations that expose OpenCode's server command catalog. Their arguments and resolved attachments are removed before composing the goal-control prompt, although OpenCode V1 may evaluate its own command syntax before plugin hooks run. `/pause_goal` persists the pause before its acknowledgement turn starts, preventing a later idle event from starting another continuation. It cannot cancel a continuation that was already delivered or whose delivery was already in flight when the pause was committed. Pausing a goal that is already `budgetLimited` or `usageLimited` preserves that safety status; resuming a closed `complete`, `unmet`, or `cancelled` goal is rejected. `/goal stop` and `/goal cancel` persist a terminal `cancelled` state and prevent further autonomous continuation. `/goal clear` archives and detaches the current goal without deleting its history; `/goal off`, `/goal reset`, and `/goal none` are clear aliases. `/goal replace <objective>` atomically cancels and archives the current goal before starting an independent replacement in the same thread. A plain `/goal <objective>` can also start a new goal after the previous one is closed or cleared. The TUI also includes a `Goal` command-palette entry for viewing, refreshing, pausing, resuming, showing history, or clearing the current goal state.

You can also ask the agent to formulate the objective and call `set_goal` itself, for example: "set your own goal to finish this refactor safely." The tool uses the agent-written objective but still only creates a goal when explicitly requested.

When writing the objective, include the scope, non-goals, and verification path when they matter. The agent is reminded to audit real files, command output, tests, or PR state before closing the goal.

The `update_goal` tool can close a goal in two ways:

- `status: "complete"` with `evidence` when every requirement is actually achieved.
- `status: "unmet"` with `blocker` when the objective cannot be achieved or is blocked by missing external input.

The plugin also uses safety states while keeping the goal available for review or resume:

- `budgetLimited` when a token budget is exhausted.
- `usageLimited` when an auto-turn or elapsed-time budget is exhausted.
- `paused` when the user pauses, auto-continue repeatedly fails, or repeated low-progress goal continuation turns are detected. No-progress accounting is scoped to goal continuation turns: each reserved continuation is evaluated once, when its turn completes, and unrelated assistant activity in the session never pauses the goal.

When a safety limit is reached, the plugin requests a concise wrap-up handoff instead of silently continuing forever. It retries an unconfirmed handoff up to `max_prompt_failures` times. If OpenCode admits the prompt but the process stops before the plugin records it, the handoff may be sent again after restart.

## Plan Mode Safety

OpenCode Plan mode is a user-controlled safety boundary, and goal mode must not become an escape hatch out of it. The plugin enforces that boundary in several layers:

- Goals created with `create_goal` or `set_goal` from the `plan` agent are recorded as `paused` with stop reason `plan mode`, never as active implementation goals. The tool response tells the agent to ask the user to switch to Build mode and resume the goal.
- Automatic idle continuation is suppressed while the last user prompt or the latest assistant turn came from a restricted agent. If a previously active goal idles under Plan mode, it is paused visibly instead of continuing autonomously.
- Resuming a goal (`update_goal_status` with `active`, or `update_goal_objective` with `status: "active"`) is refused from Plan mode, so a prompt-injected instruction inside repository content cannot self-escalate a planning session into Build-mode execution. Switching to Build mode and resuming is an explicit user action; resuming from Build updates the tracked agent so continuation restarts pinned to Build.
- Continuation prompts are pinned to the agent recorded from the last user prompt (`body.agent`), so auto-continue never silently switches the session to a different agent or mode.
- Every session receives the same compact Goal Mode system policy, regardless of whether a goal exists or which lifecycle state it is in. Dynamic objectives, limits, counters, and stop details stay in goal-tool results, continuation prompts, and compaction context; Plan-mode and safety-limit enforcement remains server-side.

The set of planning-only agents is configurable with `restricted_agents` (default `["plan"]`). Setting `allow_goal_execution_from_plan` to `true` opts out of all of these restrictions; the secure default is `false`.

## State

Goal state is stored at:

```text
$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode-goal-plugin/goals.json
```

If `XDG_DATA_HOME` is not set, the default is:

```text
~/.local/share/opencode-goal-plugin/goals.json
```

Set `OPENCODE_GOAL_STATE_PATH` to use a custom file.

The state file is written atomically through a same-directory temp file: the final path is only ever replaced by a fully-flushed file, so after a crash the state is the previous or the new valid version, never a torn one. The file is created with owner-only permissions where the host filesystem supports them, and the temp name is a random UUID opened exclusively so concurrent writers cannot collide.

Ordinary fsync improves crash consistency but is not `F_FULLFSYNC`, so sudden power loss on macOS/APFS is not an absolute durability guarantee; where the platform cannot fsync the parent directory, a crash may leave the old or the new state file (both valid), never a partially-written one. Existing active goals recover from disk with their full objective, budget, history, and checkpoint metadata. Cleared and replaced goals remain in bounded per-session history so a thread can host multiple goals over time without losing the prior lifecycle record.

The plugin migrates version 1 and 2 state files to version 3 on the next write. Version 2 introduced stable goal identities, the terminal `cancelled` status, and compact archives. Older plugin versions intentionally reject version 2 instead of silently dropping archived history on their next write; back up or isolate `OPENCODE_GOAL_STATE_PATH` before downgrading.

Version 3 adds persistent goal plans and revision metadata. Version 1 and 2 files migrate on the next write, and the sidebar accepts all three versions. Planless version 3 state remains compatible with the preceding release; populated plans and nonzero revisions require this planning release. Back up or isolate `OPENCODE_GOAL_STATE_PATH` before downgrading.

If the rename succeeds but syncing the parent directory reports a genuine I/O error, the mutation reports a write failure even though the new valid state may already be present. This avoids claiming durability that the filesystem did not confirm.

If a non-empty state file contains only whitespace, a UTF-8 BOM, or NUL bytes after an interrupted write, the next mutation preserves its exact contents beside the state file as `goals.json.corrupt-<timestamp>-<uuid>` before writing recovered state. If another process replaces the state during recovery, the mutation refuses to overwrite that newer content. If the quarantine copy itself cannot be created, the plugin reports the failure and continues recovery rather than making every prompt fail indefinitely. OpenCode 1 also records the quarantine outcome and path through its application log so the data-loss event remains discoverable.

## Credits

This plugin follows Codex's native goal-mode semantics where OpenCode plugin hooks allow it. Several hardening ideas were adapted from William Ricchiuti's [`willytop8/OpenCode-goal-plugin`](https://github.com/willytop8/OpenCode-goal-plugin), especially lifecycle history, checkpoints, no-progress safeguards, budget wrap-up behavior, and strict-provider-safe system prompt merging. Thank you, William.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run test
bun run lint
bun run typecheck
bun run build
npm pack --dry-run
```

With `opencode2` installed, run `bun run build && bun run smoke:v2` to exercise the
native V2 lifecycle, not just mocked events. The smoke test uses a private server,
isolated home/config/database/goal state, and a deterministic local model with no
real provider credentials. It invokes `/goal`, requires **two** automatic
continuations with the default minimum interval, then verifies completion. A
second loaded location checks that server-wide events do not duplicate delivery.
The test prints its temporary artifact directory and shuts down its private
server. Use `OPENCODE_V2_BIN` to select another V2 binary, or run
`bun run smoke:v2 @yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin@<version>` to install and
verify an exact published package in the isolated environment.

## Publishing

Branching and release rules live in [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md). This package is set up for npm Trusted Publishing from GitHub Actions. Releases are cut from tags: pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag (matching `package.json`) runs typecheck, lint, tests, and the V2 smoke in parallel; if they pass, the publish job builds the package, runs `npm publish`, and creates the GitHub release. Merging to `main` publishes only a `dev` snapshot (`X.Y.Z-dev.N.sha` under the `dev` dist-tag, no git tag or GitHub release); `latest` changes only on a tag.

Before the first automated publish, configure the package on npm:

1. Open the package settings on npmjs.com.
2. Add a Trusted Publisher for GitHub Actions.
3. Use repository `yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin`.
4. Use workflow file `publish.yml`.

The repository must be public for npm provenance to be generated automatically.

## Notes

OpenCode plugin modules are target-specific. This package exports separate modules for server hooks/tools and TUI UI:

```json
{
  "exports": {
    "./server": "./dist/server.js",
    "./tui": "./src/tui.ts"
  }
}
```

Codex goal mode has deeper runtime integration for thread lifecycle control. This plugin implements the same workflow using OpenCode plugin hooks. Token usage is read from OpenCode step-finish usage when available and falls back to message token metadata or text estimation when exact usage is unavailable. Continuation is driven by V2 `session.execution.succeeded` events and legacy `session.idle` / `session.status` idle notifications, never by intermediate model-step completion. V2 execution starts arm busy tracking; native `session.retry.scheduled` events cancel plugin recovery while OpenCode retries. Terminal execution transport failures use bounded recovery. A V2 `session.execution.interrupted` event with reason `user`, or a V1 session/assistant `MessageAbortedError`, persists a terminal `cancelled` state for an active goal and invalidates timers and outstanding continuation preparation without charging a prompt failure. A later idle, unrelated prompt, or plugin reload cannot resume that goal; start an explicitly requested new goal with `/goal <objective>` or `/goal replace <objective>`. Cancelling a manual turn preserves paused or limited goals. V2 shutdown, superseded, and other interruptions only suppress local continuation until the host starts another execution; they do not cancel the persisted goal. V1 exposes only `MessageAbortedError`, so it cannot distinguish user cancellation from other host aborts of an active goal. Use `/pause_goal` for a durable, resumable pause. Each V2 plugin instance handles goal events only for its own location while still observing cross-location child task lifecycles. The optional `max_turn_time` watchdog can retry one goal continuation prompt when a model turn remains busy, without consuming the goal's auto-turn or no-progress budgets; recognized transport failures do count toward the prompt-failure ceiling. By default, continuation is deferred while OpenCode Task child sessions are active or their terminal result still needs an orchestrator turn, bounded by the `max_task_block_seconds` ceiling so an unobservable child cannot stall a goal indefinitely. During compaction on OpenCode 1, the plugin disables OpenCode's generic synthetic auto-continue while an active goal exists so the goal-specific continuation prompt remains authoritative; on OpenCode 2, compaction runs inside the session's execution flow, so the plugin instead injects the goal snapshot through the `session.compaction` hook where the host provides it.

The goal sidebar shows the current status, elapsed time, token usage, auto-continue count, latest checkpoint, latest status message, stop reason, and objective when a goal is active, paused, or safety-limited. It checks the shared goal state file every second so usage and checkpoints stay current during a long run. Closed goals remain visible briefly through the latest tool state as achieved or unmet.

Human-wait recovery is limited by host APIs. OpenCode 2 re-lists pending permissions after restart; it cannot list pending forms, so a form left pending across restart is not restored. If permission listing fails after bounded retries, the goal stays blocked even without a persisted wait. Later owned permission/form events trigger a rate-limited re-list; only a successful authoritative list verifies the inventory, and all remaining requests must resolve before automation resumes. An arbitrary reply does not release this recovery block. OpenCode 1 tracks live permission/question events but cannot restore waits after restart.

### Zed and ACP lifecycle boundaries

Cancelling an active goal from an ACP client is durable when OpenCode emits the user-cancellation events described above. The plugin prevents subsequent goal continuations, including callbacks still preparing a prompt when cancellation arrives. OpenCode owns cancellation of in-flight model requests, tools, subprocesses, and already submitted prompts; the plugin cannot guarantee process termination if the host does not abort them or does not publish a cancellation signal. It does not interpret ordinary idle events, provider-error text, or completed tool calls as user cancellation.

Registered `/goal <objective>` and `/resume_goal` commands use the host's public session-wait API to remain pending across automatic continuations until the goal stops, completes, reaches a safety limit, or auto-continuation is disabled. Hosts without that API keep their previous admission behavior. The ACP adapter must also stream each execution owned by the command: an adapter that ends its event consumer after the first execution can still hide later work. The [OpenCode command-lifetime integration](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/53913) fixes that adapter behavior and supplies explicit interruption hooks. Ordinary prompts retain their host-defined turn lifetime.

### Persistent plans and ACP

For multi-phase goals, `update_goal_plan` saves the overall completion criteria, phases, tasks, decisions, verification evidence, and a bounded revision history. Read `get_goal` first and send `goal_id`, `expected_revision`, `plan`, and a `reason`. The returned `planProgress` identifies the current task, next phase, and completed work. Concurrent or delayed updates to a replaced or edited goal are rejected.

Marking a task completed requires evidence; completing a phase requires all its tasks and phase verification. Start the next phase only after verifying the current phase. Completed work cannot be removed, and reopening it requires `revisit_evidence`. Removing or changing pending scope also requires concrete `revisit_evidence`, recorded with the revision. Overall completion criteria stay fixed until the user explicitly changes the goal's objective with `/goal edit <objective>` or replaces the goal. A goal with an unfinished plan cannot be marked complete. Explicit objective edits clear the old plan and increment its revision. Existing state files migrate automatically; plan data survives compaction and is retained in goal history.

Goal tools publish standard ACP plan entries in `metadata.acp.plan`, with richer goal state in its `_meta` field. An ACP host that projects this metadata can display task progress and replay it when reloading a conversation. This requires the [OpenCode ACP plan projection](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/53929); a plugin update alone cannot change an older adapter's UI. Finishing a task or phase leaves the overall goal active.

The Promise-based persistence layer uses Effect 3 under the private `effect-goal-state` npm alias. This keeps it separate from modern OpenCode's shared Effect 4 SDK runtime. It remains an external runtime dependency, and no private Effect values cross the plugin API.

ACP permits one pending prompt per session. While a goal command is open, use Cancel to interrupt it; `/pause_goal` cannot be submitted as a second ACP prompt until that request ends.

## Linting & Formatting

This project uses a self-contained lint/format bundle rooted in `scripts/style.sh`. Run it directly, via the package-manager aliases below, or wire it into CI.

### One-command bootstrap

If you cloned this repo fresh and `scripts/style.sh` is missing (it ships managed), re-run `ycc:formatters --sync` from Claude Code to reinstall the bundle.

### Daily commands

```bash
./scripts/style.sh lint                  # full lint pass (all detected languages)
./scripts/style.sh lint --fix            # auto-fix what is auto-fixable
./scripts/style.sh lint --modified       # staged + unstaged + untracked
./scripts/style.sh lint --staged         # only files staged in the git index
./scripts/style.sh lint --unstaged       # only unstaged + untracked changes
./scripts/style.sh lint --fix --modified # fast pre-push loop
./scripts/style.sh format                # format everything
./scripts/style.sh format --modified     # format modified files
./scripts/style.sh format --staged       # format only staged files
./scripts/style.sh format --unstaged     # format only unstaged + untracked
```

### npm aliases

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:modified
npm run lint:staged
npm run lint:unstaged
npm run lint:fix
npm run lint:fix:modified
npm run format
npm run format:modified
npm run format:staged
npm run format:unstaged
```

### Per-language tools

- **TypeScript / JavaScript**: `@biomejs/biome` for lint + format + import sort on JS/TS/CSS/JSON/JSONC. Runs `biome ci` in CI. `tsc --noEmit` runs when `tsconfig*.json` is present.

- **Docs**: `markdownlint` + `prettier` (`.markdownlint.json`, `.prettierrc`) for Markdown/YAML. In docs-only repos, Prettier also owns JSON/JSONC.

- **Shell**: `shellcheck --severity=warning` on `*.sh`.

### CI

To wire lint into CI, run `ycc:formatters --ci` (installs both `lint.yml` and `lint-autofix.yml`) or pair it with `--no-autofix` to skip the autofix workflow.

### Pre-commit hook (optional)

A pre-commit hook is installed. It runs `./scripts/style.sh lint --modified --fix` before every commit. To bypass once: `git commit --no-verify`.

### Advanced

- **Upgrade the bundle**: re-run `ycc:formatters --sync` from Claude Code. This prunes stale managed files and copies the latest scripts.
- **Ignore paths**: add entries to `.prettierignore`, `.markdownlintignore`, `.gitignore`, or tool-native ignore keys (`ruff exclude`, `biome files.ignore`, `.golangci.yml issues.exclude-rules`).
- **Modified-only mode** reads `git diff --name-only HEAD` — untracked files are included when `scripts/lib/modified-files.sh` sees them with `git status --porcelain`.
