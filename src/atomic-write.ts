 * The temp name is a random UUID and the temp file is opened with the

 * temp path and a stale temp file can never be overwritten.
 *
 * The temp file is fsync'd before the rename, so the final path never exposes
 * an empty or partially-flushed file after a crash: the state file is always
 * the old or the new valid version. Ordinary fsync improves crash consistency
 * (process and OS crashes); on macOS/APFS it is not a substitute for
 * `F_FULLFSYNC`, which Node.js cannot issue, so sudden power loss has no
 * absolute durability guarantee there.
 *
 * On POSIX the parent directory is fsync'd after the rename so the rename
 * itself is durable too. Failures propagate unless the platform reports that
 * directory fsync is unsupported; when unsupported (Windows, some
 * filesystems), a crash may leave the old or the new file, but never a torn
 * one.
 *
 * Rename is retried a bounded number of times on transient Windows
 * replacement errors (`EPERM` / `EACCES` / `EBUSY`) because another process
 * may briefly hold the target state file open.
 *
 * If any step before the rename eventually fails, the temp file is unlinked
 * best-effort. The original error is preserved even when close/unlink cleanup
 * also fails. Once the rename has succeeded, the final file is never unlinked:
 * a later chmod or directory-sync failure is either tolerated (unsupported
 * directory fsync) or propagated honestly (EIO / ENOSPC / ...) with the new
 * content already in place.
