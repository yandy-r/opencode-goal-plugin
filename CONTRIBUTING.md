# Contributing to OpenCode Goal Plugin

Thanks for your interest in improving `@yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin`. This guide explains how to set up the project, make changes, and get them merged.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (the project is built, tested, and bundled with Bun)
- An [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) install if you want to try the plugin end to end

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin.git
cd opencode-goal-plugin
bun install
```

Useful scripts:

| Script                  | What it does                              |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `bun run test`          | Run the unit test suite                   |
| `bun run test:coverage` | Run the test suite with a coverage report |
| `bun run lint`          | ESLint over the repo                      |
| `bun run typecheck`     | TypeScript `--noEmit` check               |
| `bun run build`         | Bundle `src/server.ts` into `dist/`       |
| `bun run pack:dry-run`  | Inspect the npm package contents          |

## Project layout

- `src/server.ts` — OpenCode server hooks, goal tools, auto-continuation.
- `src/state.ts` — persistent goal state, budgets, history, checkpoints.
- `src/prompts.ts` — continuation, wrap-up, and system reminder prompts.
- `src/tui.tsx` — terminal UI goal indicator and command palette entry.
- `test/` — Bun test suites mirroring the source modules.
- `CONTEXT.md` — shared domain vocabulary for goal-mode behavior.

## Making changes

1. Create a topic branch from `main`.
2. Make your change, keeping the existing code style (no semicolons, 130-column lines, strict TypeScript).
3. Add or update tests — behavior changes need regression coverage.
4. Run the local gates: `bun run test && bun run lint && bun run typecheck && bun run build`.
5. Commit the rebuilt `dist/server.js` when `src/server.ts` (or its imports) changed — the built file is tracked on purpose.
6. Open a pull request against `main` describing the problem, the approach, and how you verified it. Link the related issue (`Closes #NN`) when one exists. The pull request description must also name the AI model and agent harness used (for example, OpenCode or Claude Code), or explicitly state that the change was made manually.

## CI and releases

- Every pull request runs typecheck, lint, tests with coverage, and a build via GitHub Actions. All checks must pass before merge.
- Every push to `main` re-runs the gates and, if green, automatically publishes a patch release to npm and creates a GitHub release. Merging a PR ships it — please keep `main` releasable.

## Reporting bugs and requesting features

Use the [issue templates](https://github.com/yandy-r/opencode-goal-plugin/issues/new/choose). Include your OpenCode version, plugin version, install method, and reproduction steps for bugs.

For security issues, do not open a public issue — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
